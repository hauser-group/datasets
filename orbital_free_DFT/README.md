The CSV files contain the parameters used to generate the potentials.

The HDF5 files contain solutions of the Schroedinger equation corresponding
to the potential found using Numerov's method.

Note that there is no HDF5 file for the M=100000 training set as this file exceeds
the 100 MB GitHub file size limit.
